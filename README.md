Meal Tracker is a simple and convenient web project for monitoring your calorie intake(Calorie Counter).

Users can register and login. They can set a calorie goal for the day, add food they have eaten and monitor their progress.

Unauthenticated users can see some sample menus that the admin has decided to suggest through which they can use as a meal plan for the whole week.

Staff can add and edit menus.
Administrators have full control of the application.
